=======
The information hiding secrets of each of your classes (i.e., what design decisions are entirely encapsulated within that class).


Objects:
- Eyetracker
- Drawing canvas
- Buttons

Hierarchy:
Buttons - 2 types:
                - change color
                - start and stop drawing


Secrets:
Only the eyetracker will know infomation about the WebGazer and its
        functionality. The drawing canvas will take in location data from
        the eyetracker to know where to draw. It will also take in input from
        the buttons to know when to run the draw commands and what color to use.
